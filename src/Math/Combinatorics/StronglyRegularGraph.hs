-- |A module defining various strongly regular graphs, including the Clebsch, Hoffman-Singleton, Higman-Sims, and McLaughlin graphs.
--
-- A strongly regular graph with parameters (n,k,lambda,mu) is a (simple) graph with n vertices,
-- in which the number of common neighbours of x and y is k, lambda or mu according as whether
-- x and y are equal, adjacent, or non-adjacent. (In particular, it is a k-regular graph.)
--
-- Strongly regular graphs are highly symmetric, and have large automorphism groups.
