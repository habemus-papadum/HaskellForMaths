-- |A module for doing arithmetic in permutation groups.
--
-- Group elements are represented as permutations of underlying sets, and are entered and displayed
-- using a Haskell-friendly version of cycle notation. For example, the permutation (1 2 3)(4 5)
-- would be entered as @p [[1,2,3],[4,5]]@, and displayed as [[1,2,3],[4,5]]. Permutations can be defined
-- over arbitrary underlying sets (types), not just the integers.
--
-- If @g@ and @h@ are group elements, then the expressions @g*h@ and @g^-1@ calculate product and inverse respectively.
