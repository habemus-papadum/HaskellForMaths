-- |A module providing elementary operations involving scalars, vectors, and matrices
-- over a ring or field. Vectors are represented as [a], matrices as [[a]].
-- (No distinction is made between row and column vectors.)
-- It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the lists have the correct number of elements.
--
-- The mnemonic for many of the arithmetic operations is that the number of angle brackets
-- on each side indicates the dimension of the argument on that side. For example,
-- v \<*\>\> m is multiplication of a vector on the left by a matrix on the right.
