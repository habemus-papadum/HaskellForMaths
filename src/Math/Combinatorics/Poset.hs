-- ANALYSIS OF POSETS

-- The Hasse digraph of a poset is the digraph whose vertices are the elements of the poset,
-- with an edge between every pair (x,y) with x -< y.
-- The Hasse digraph can be represented diagrammatically as a Hasse diagram, by drawing x below y whenever x -< y.

-- The partial order can be recovered as the transitive closure of the covers relation
-- !! Can we construct the cover graph without having to compare every pair ??

-- If we know in advance the poset we're interested in,
-- then we're probably better off constructing the Hasse digraph directly

-- (In effect, the transitive closure of the edge relation)
-- |Given a DAG (directed acyclic graph), return the poset consisting of the vertices of the DAG, ordered by reachability.
